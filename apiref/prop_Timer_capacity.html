<dt>Explanation</dt>
<dd><p>Specifies how many events can be fired at one time.<br />
You can also set the value.<br />
It may not be possible to process the timer event, such as when processing is performed longer than the timer cycle.<br />
At this time, the timer stores events in the event queue, but there is an upper limit to the number of events that can be stored in the event queue.<br />
This property specifies the maximum number.<br />
When it comes time to process the events, Kirikiri tries to process the number of events in the queue at one time.<br />
If you specify 1, only one event can be stored in the event queue.<br />
Specifying 0 does not limit the number of events that can be stored in the event queue, but be aware that if too many events are stored, it may appear to freeze.<br />
The default is 6.</p>
