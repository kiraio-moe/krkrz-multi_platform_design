<h1>KiriKiri Z Multi-Platform API Reference</h1>

<p>KiriKiri Z Multi-platform API reference.  </p>

<h1>About the multi-platform version</h1>

<p>It is a version that works on Android in addition to Windows.  <br />
GPU drawing is the main draw so that drawing speed can be obtained even in a weak environment.  <br />
Currently it is not partially compatible with older versions.  </p>

<h1>Environment-dependent functions</h1>

<p>Not all methods and properties are available in the multi-platform version in all environments.  <br />
Some functions are specific to the environment.  <br />
Environment-specific methods etc. are written at the beginning of the sentence as [Windows] or [Android] in the explanation summary.  <br />
Methods etc. written that way can only be used in that environment.  <br />
Some call nothing and some exceptions occur.  <br />
For more information, use the trailing symbol as shown below.  </p>

<ul>
<li>[Windows+] It can be used only on Windows, and it is prohibited to use it in other environments because there are exceptions and indefinite operation.</li>
<li>[Windows*] It can be used on Windows, and nothing happens in other environments.</li>
<li>[Windows] It can be used on Windows, and its operation is uncertain in other environments.</li>
<li>[Android+] It can be used on Android, and it is prohibited to use it in other environments because there are exceptions and indefinite behavior.</li>
<li>[Android*] It can be used on Android, and nothing happens in other environments.</li>
<li>[Android] It can be used on Android, and its operation is uncertain in other environments.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can dynamically determine which environment you have by using the <code>System.isWindows</code> or <code>System.isAndroid</code> properties.<br />
For static judgment, use the preprocessor.<br />
"Windows" is set to 1 on Windows and "android" is set to 1 on Android.  <br />
When making a static judgment, be aware that the output result of bytecode depends on the environment.  <br />
The bytecode for the compiled environment is output.  <br />
To avoid this, it is necessary to change the preprocessor value in advance before calling the compile function to make it suitable for each environment and bytecode it.</p>
