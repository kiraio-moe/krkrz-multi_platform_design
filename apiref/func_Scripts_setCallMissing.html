<dt>Explanation</dt>
<dd><p>Set the missing method to be called when no member is found.<br />
If no member is found in the object registered by this method, the method will be called in the form of function missing (isset, name, prop).<br />
isset is set if true, get if false.<br />
name is the name of the member that was not found.<br />
prop is the assignment destination of the value to be assigned at the time of setting and the value to be returned at the time of acquisition.<br />
If the name member is not found by the missing method, it returns a non-zero value.<br />
If you return a non-zero, you will get an exception that the member cannot be found.<br />
Even if the function is not found, it will be called with get.<br />
Since the finalize function is also the target, it is better to define the finalize function in the class that sets this.</p>
