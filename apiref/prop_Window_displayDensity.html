<dd><p>Returns the dpi value.<br />
Only read is possible.<br />
For Windows, this is the value obtained with GetDeviceCaps.<br />
Android is a config value, and some values are returned from the screen size.<br />
When excluding input by swiping in from the side of the screen, Android recognizes (int) (20 * displayDensity + 0.5) as the range of the screen corner, so when touchDown is in this range, swipe in as well. Should be considered.<br />
On Android, swipe-ins other than from the right at full screen are assigned functions, so it is recommended to ignore them when it is judged to be a swipe-in.<br />
When you want to display the menu, it is common on Android to display the menu by swiping in from the right.</p>
