<dt>Explanation</dt>
<dd><p>Represents a pointer to the upper left corner of the image buffer for the main image (a 32bpp bitmap containing color and mask (opacity) information).<br />
This property is there to provide a means of direct access to the image buffer for plugins etc.<br />
It is returned as an integer type, but for plugins etc., cast it to an appropriate type (unsigned long * etc.) and use it.<br />
Unlike Layer.mainImageBuffer, you can write a value to the pointer obtained by this property.<br />
Inside Kirikiri, the exact same image is shared between multiple layers, etc., but if you refer to this property, the shared state will be canceled.<br />
Returns NULL (0) if no image has been assigned to the layer.<br />
The size of the image is represented by the Layer.imageWidth and Layer.imageHeight properties.<br />
See Layer.mainImageBufferPitch for how to calculate the pointer.</p>
