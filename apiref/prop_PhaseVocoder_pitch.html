<dd><p>Represents the scale in the frequency axis direction.<br />
You can also set the value.<br />
The number that can be specified is greater than 0.0.<br />
If you specify 1.0, the scale along the frequency axis does not change (the pitch does not change).<br />
For example, if you specify 1.0594630943593, the pitch will be increased by a semitone.<br />
For example, if you specify 0.9438743126817, the pitch will be lowered by a semitone.<br />
The Phase Vocoder filter works even if both the time and pitch properties are 1, the sound quality is slightly degraded, and it also uses CPU time.<br />
If you want to keep both at 1, it's a good idea to remove this filter from the filter array.<br />
Changes to this property will be reflected in real time, but due to buffering, it will take about 2 seconds to actually play.</p>
