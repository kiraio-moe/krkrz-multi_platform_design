<p>The speed is faster in the order of stNearest> stFastLinear> stLinear> stCubic, but the faster the speed, the lower the image quality.<br />
The interpolation method after stCubic has sufficiently high image quality and can be said to be a difference in taste.<br />
However, the image quality will be blurry for Gaussian interpolation.<br />
The difference between stFastLinear and other linear interpolations (stSemiFastLinear and stLinear) is large when shrinking.<br />
While stFastLinear always refers to the surrounding 4 pixels, stSemiFastLinear and stLinear refer to and interpolate a range in which the influence range at 1x magnification is 4 pixels at the time of reduction, that is, a wider range of pixels. Higher image quality (algorithm is the original linear interpolation).<br />
For stFastLinear, stRefNoClip can be additionally specified by bitwise OR, in which case it is allowed to refer to the outside of the area of the bitmap to be copied and synthesize the color.<br />
If this is not specified, the out-of-range color will not refer to the closest pixel in the range, even if there is room around the source bitmap. It is considered a color).</p>
