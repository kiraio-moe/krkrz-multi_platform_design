<dt>Explanation</dt>
<dd><p>Represents the event occurrence cycle.<br />
You can also set the value.<br />
The unit is ms (milliseconds), and the event fires every specified time.<br />
You can also specify the generation cycle with a real number.<br />
In the current version, you can specify with a precision of 1/65536 milliseconds (numbers after the decimal point are rounded to this precision).<br />
Even if it has an accuracy of about 1/65536 milliseconds, there is no guarantee that the event handler will actually be called with this accuracy.<br />
Actually, there is a fluctuation of about 3 to 10 ms when the event is called.<br />
However, on average and in the long run, the event will be automatically adjusted to occur at the cycle specified by this property.</p>
