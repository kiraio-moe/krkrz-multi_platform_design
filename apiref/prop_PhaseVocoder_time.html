<dt>Explanation</dt>
<dd><p>Represents a scale along the time axis. You can also set the value.<br />
Possible numbers are real numbers greater than 0.<br />
However, if the value is too small, the CPU load will be high, and in the worst case, playback may not be possible.<br />
In addition, the sound quality deteriorates from around 1.95, and the sound quality may not be improved even if the overlap is increased (due to the characteristics of the internal algorithm).<br />
If you specify 1.0, the scale along the time axis does not change (the playback speed does not change).<br />
For example, if you specify 1.5, the scale along the time axis will be 1.5 times faster and the playback will be slower (playback will take 1.5 times longer).<br />
For example, if you specify 0.5, the scale along the time axis will be 0.5 times faster and will play faster (play at double speed).<br />
The Phase Vocoder filter works even if both the time and pitch properties are 1, the sound quality is slightly degraded, and it also uses CPU time.<br />
If you want to keep both at 1, it's a good idea to remove this filter from the filter array.<br />
Changes to this property will be reflected in real time, but due to buffering, it will take about 2 seconds to actually play.<br />
In addition, noise may occur when switching.</p>
