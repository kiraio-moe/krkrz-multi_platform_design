<dt>Explanation</dt>
<dd><p>Represents the overlap count (oversampling factor).<br />
Specify a number that is 0 or a power of 2 between 2 and 32.<br />
The default is 0.<br />
If you specify 0, the appropriate value is set according to the value of the current time property.<br />
Increasing this number will increase the resolution along the time axis.<br />
Especially when slowing down the playback speed, it is better to set a large number.<br />
Increasing the value will use more CPU.<br />
Changes to this property will be reflected in real time, but due to buffering, it will take about 2 seconds to actually play.<br />
In addition, noise may occur when switching.</p>
